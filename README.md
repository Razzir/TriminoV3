# TriminoV3

Each trimino have "Charge" abstraction. When we connect trimino with other trimino which positive Charge, the first trimino will take negative charge.
It's work also if second have negative Charge, we work with first like it has positive Charge.
This abstraction help us to choose right Direction(vector) and Value(value). 
In future, it will be need for updte to situation, when we connect trimino figuries, that created after few fish.

Fish - situation, when we place trimino and create by that the hexagone.
